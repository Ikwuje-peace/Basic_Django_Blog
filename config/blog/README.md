Hello World!
This is just a simple blog I created.
It is functional as it follows the CRUD blog process
Users can Create Posts
Users can Read Posts
Users can Update and Edit posts
And Also delete posts too.


It is a very very basic Django blog site and I just made use of a blog template for the frontend view, deleted a couple of things, added somethings too to make it look how it looks right now.

The limitations of this blog is the authentication, right now, users can edit and delete any post as long as they are logged in even if it not the post they made themselves, like I said earlier before this is a very basic blog site, so if you can figure a way to change that please do, meanwhile look forward as I will be uploading another entirely functional django app with all of the features it is suppose to have.

As at the the time  created this as uploaded it, there is no testcase in this project which we all know is not a good thing. I am improving in my django skills and I will get better by he next project I upload.

The wesite static template was gotten from mediumish.com.

The loop in the home page will always print out the same picture for every post.

Thanks for reading till this point. 
See you when I upload my next project
